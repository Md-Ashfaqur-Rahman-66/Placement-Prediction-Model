## Steps in this Project

1. **Preprocess Data + EDA + Feature Selection**  
   - Perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature selection.

2. **Extract Input and Output Columns**  
   - Identify and separate the input features and output (target) variable.

3. **Scale the Values**  
   - Scale the data to normalize or standardize the values for better model performance.

4. **Train-Test Split**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Train the Model**  
   - Use the training data to train the model.

6. **Evaluate the Model / Model Selection**  
   - Evaluate the model's performance and select the best model if needed.

7. **Deploy the Model**  
   - Deploy the final model for production or future predictions.
