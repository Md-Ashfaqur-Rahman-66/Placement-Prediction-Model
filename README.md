# Placement Prediction Model

This project aims to predict placements using machine learning. The following files are part of the project:

1. **`model.pkl` (PKL File)**  
   This file contains a **serialized machine learning model** saved using `pickle`. It holds the trained model which can be loaded later for making predictions without the need for retraining.

2. **`Placement Prediction Model.ipynb` (IPYNB File)**  
   This is a **Jupyter Notebook** that contains the code for building, training, and testing the machine learning model. It includes steps like data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

3. **`placement.csv` (CSV File)**  
   This **CSV file** contains the dataset used for training the machine learning model. It includes various features (such as CGPA, IQ) and the target variable (placement status).

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `pickle`, `matplotlib`, etc.


## Steps used in this Project

1. **Preprocess Data + EDA + Feature Selection**  
   - Perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature selection.

2. **Extract Input and Output Columns**  
   - Identify and separate the input features and output (target) variable.

3. **Scale the Values**  
   - Scale the data to normalize or standardize the values for better model performance.

4. **Train-Test Split**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Train the Model**  
   - Use the training data to train the model.

6. **Evaluate the Model / Model Selection**  
   - Evaluate the model's performance and select the best model if needed.

7. **Deploy the Model**  
   - Deploy the final model for production or future predictions.
